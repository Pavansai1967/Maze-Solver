  - Randomized Depth-First
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm
  - Wilson's Algorithm
  - Aldous-Broder Algorithm
  - Recursive Division
- **5 Pathfinding Algorithms**:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Bidirectional BFS
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Search
- Interactive grid editing
- Real-time visualization
- Responsive design

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- HTML5/CSS3
- SVG for icons
